This is a test for Python Midterms, it has been written by dkjfsa
Concatenation
How would you CONCATENATE Cat and Dog into a single word?
"Cat" + "Dog"
Cat + Dog
Cat,Dog
"Cat","Dog"
1
Concatenation is adding the String to the other String./ The result of this would be CatDog
Concatenation
What do programmers call the process of joining together two strings?
Gluing
Joining
Melding
Concatenation
4
It is a common term used among programmers to describe adding two words together.
Data Types
What do we call an area in computer memory that holds a named value?
Vault
Variable
Locker
Dictionary
2
Variable is the terminology used as an area in computer memory that holds a value.
Data Types
Which of the following values is not a valid integer?
-2
1000
5.5
0
3
Since 5.5 is a number containing a decimal and is not a whole number, it is not / a valid integer.
Variable Assigning
How would you assign the value 1000 to an integer named bigNumber?
bigNumber = 1000
bigNumber(1000)
bigNumber = 1,000
The number is too large to be assigned
1
To assign a number to a variable, you simply put the number OUT OF QUOTES in front / of the equals sign.
Print Statements
Which of the following statements will print GO FOR IT to the screen?
print"GO FOR IT"
display("GO FOR IT")
print("GO FOR IT")
show(GO FOR IT)
3
To print text to a screen, you would use print() and put the text you want printed/ in quotation marks inside of the parenthesis
Floating Point Numbers
Which of the following is not a valid floating point number?
-12.4
"Three Point Five"
3.0
All of these are invalid
2
"Three Point Five" is a String, not a number.
Print Statements
Which of the following statements about the print() function are true?
print() with a single string parameter will display the exact string you pass in
print() with multiple parameters will automatically convert all values to strings/and join them together with a space
Neither of these are true
Both of these are true
4
print() can be used with a single parameter, or as many parameters as you want.
Getting User Input
What type of data does the input() function return?
String
Floating Point Number
Integer
It depends on what the user types in
1
An input() will always return a String unless parsed.
Getting User Input
Which of the following best describes the input() parameter?
It contains the length of time the function will wait for an answer
It contains the name of the variable that will hold the output
It contains a text prompt for the user to enter a value
It contains the number of values the user must enter
3
If you do input("Scream") it will print "Scream" out to the screen, but will also/be waiting for input.
Getting User Input
If the user enters 18 in response to an input() question, what kind of data is returned?
An integer containing 18
A floating point containing 18.0
A string containing 18
A True Boolean value showing success
3
An input() function will always return a String unless parsed.
Parsing Data
Which function would you use to convert a string value to a floating point value?
parse()
int()
decimal()
float()
4
float() will parse any data type passed in, into a floating point number.
String Formatting
How many input parameters are provided to the str.format() function?
1 or more as needed to build your output string
3 only
1 only
None
1
You can pass as many parameters in as needed with the str.format() function.
Data Types
Which of the following data types holds only True and False values?
Integer
Boolean
Floating Point
String
2
True and False are Boolean values.
Mathematical Operators
Which of the following operators mean equal to?
<
>=
!
==
4
The == operator means equal to.
Mathematical Operators
If "numGrapes" is equal to 10, which of the following expressions will produce a/ False result?
numGrapes != 10
numGrapes < 9
numGrapes >= 11
All of these are false
4
None of these expressions are true.
Mathematical Operators
Which of the following is NOT a mathematical operator?
+
Slash
!=
*
3
!= are contradictive to each other. You can't equal but not equal something.
Logical Equations
The if statement relies on what type of expression?
Mathematical
Logical
Assignment
Repeating
2
An if statement will only work if it is used with a logical expression, an expression / returning true or false.
Bonus Questions
What is the answer to this question?
This one?
Maybe this one?
How about this one?
Hmmmmmmmmm.
3
If you got it wrong, maybe you should have checked the code ;)
Bonus Questions
What is 30*200*15+0
Too many numbers
5646432156
121244522
90000
